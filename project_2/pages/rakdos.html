    <p>Prosper, Tome Bound is the commander of this deck. He lets me exile a card until the end of my next turn, which basically means I have a one turn timer to cast that card or I lose it forever. His second ability gives you a treasure every time you cast a card from exile, which works off of his first ability! The focus of this deck is to cast cards from exile, to gain treasure tokens. 
        Treasures can be sacrificed for a mana of any color, which is a powerful one-off effect that essentially gives you more resources to work with. His colors are Rakdos, which is black and red.</p>

        <p>Jeska's Will: This cheap spell can quickly put you in the lead in a game by providing you with tons of mana, and is considered one of the strongest cards in Commander.</p>
