    <p>Hello, I’m Alex, currently working on my associate’s degree in Software Application Design and Development. This is my
    first semester at MCC, and I have enjoyed my time here so far.
    Music is a big part of my life. I’m always alternating between different bands and artists. Right now, it’s the indie
    sound of Men I Trust, Clairo’s mellow tunes, The Marías’ dreamy sound, or Kendrick Lamar’s incredible storytelling.
    I also enjoy playing tabletop games like Magic: The Gathering and Pokémon. I’m also a fan of board games. As for video
    games, I get a kick out of the teamwork in Lethal Company and R.E.P.O, but I also love the big-brain strategy of Hearts
    of Iron 4.</p>
