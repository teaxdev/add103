        <p>Music is very important to me. I’m currently really into indie bands and anything with an interesting sound.
             My favorites at the moment are Men I Trust, Clairo, The Marías, and Kendrick Lamar—each with their own distinct style.
            The album cover on the right is Submarine by The Marias, they're one of my new favorite bands.</p>

        <img id="float-left" src="../images/sling.jpg" alt="'Sling' by Clairo">
        <p>Men I Trust has a soft indie feel, Clairo’s music is personal and calming, The Marías blend smooth vocals with a hypnotic sound, and Kendrick Lamar’s storytelling is just on another level. 
            Regardless of what I am doing I always have music playing.
            I enjoy making playlists to match what music I'm currently interested in (it changes a lot), whether it’s something soothing or more energetic. I am always looking for new music, so feel free to share any recommendations.
            The album on the left is Sling by Clairo.
