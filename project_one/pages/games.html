        <p>Gaming has always been a big part of my life. Whether I’m throwing together a wild deck in Magic: The Gathering or jumping into co-op chaos with friends, I enjoy the experience. I’d call myself a casual gamer.
            In Magic, I like testing out different decks, and my favorite card is Sneaky Snacker, as it has my favorite card art. </p>

        <p>Pokémon is another favorite, whether it’s collecting the cards or battling in the games. My favorite Pokémon game is Black 2.
            When it comes to video games, I play a little bit of everything. I appreciate the eerie, teamwork-focused atmosphere
             in Lethal Company and R.E.P.O, but I also enjoy the deep strategy and alt-history fun of Hearts of Iron 4.</p>
