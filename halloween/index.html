    <h1>Pumpkin Cat!</h1>
    <div id="gary">

        <p>This is a cool looking cat and hes chilling out in a pumpkin. I've decided to name him Gary. Gary loves halloween,
        hence the pumpkin. He likes large pumpkins because they are a great space to be in. His favorite part about 
        halloween is obviously the pumpkins! Halloween is a holiday that has plenty of candy to go around, and humans dress up as fictional
        characters, animals, celebrities and people of differing professions.

        <p>The halloween night sky creates an eerie and exciting atmosphere. Gary says that he enjoys the darkness,
            as it shrouds him when he wants to hunt his prey. Gary comes from a long lineage of cats from the 
            15th century, when halloween was first celebrated. His family specializes in pumpkin sitting, napping, and 
            nocturnal hunting. Gary is one of the most fearsome known from his rich family history

    <div id="pumpkin">
        <img src="images/smoky-pumpkin.jpg" alt="smoky pumpkin">
        <p>This is the most fearsome pumpkin known to man. It's ominous aura strikes fear in even the bravest
            individuals. With good reason as well, as it's a pumpkin even Gary wouldn't dare to be in, let alone approach.
            It's devious smile strikes fear in the hearts of all beings, and it's ominous smoke is thought to be poisonous.
            Many cats have strived to find and nap inside of this evil pumpkin, but none have survived 
            to tell the tale.
