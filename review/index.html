    <!--Add a paragraph describing what you are going to review. This should be 2-3 sentences -->
    <p>Oncle Jazz is the 3rd album by the indie band <em>Men I Trust</em>.
    I have recently discovered them this month and I have been actively listening
    to their music since then.</p>
    <!--Add a H2 tag describing characters, game play, or some specific part of your review-->
    <h2>Oncle Jazz contains my favorite song by Men I Trust, called "Numb".
    </h2>
    <!--Add a paragraph about whatever your H2 tag was-->
    <p>The song gives out a unique vibe that stands out to me, past the bands already unique style.</p>
    <!--Add an H3 tag about a scene or character, include a quote in the paragraph-->
    <h3>It also has their most popular song <ul>"Show me how"</ul> and another one of my
    favorites, "I hope to be around".</h3>
